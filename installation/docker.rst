Docker Installation
********************

Our goal is to offer a powerful set of APIs that is easy to deploy and maintain. We use Docker to package our app. Follow these simple steps to be up and running in minutes:

1. Install `Docker https://docs.docker.com/install/` and `Docker Compose https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/` on the host environment.
2. Clone the repository: ``git clone git@github.com:Navagis-LLC/Callidus.git``
3. Run ``docker-compose up --build``. You can add an additional `-d` "detached" flag and Docker will run the containers in the background.

Grab a cup of coffee! ;-)
